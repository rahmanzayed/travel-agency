		 <p>
			Skydiving is an incredibly exciting adrenaline fueled sport that tens of thousands of people across the world enjoy every year.
			The sheer volume of skydives that happen across the world means that we have tons of data to show that while the sport has risks, it can be done safely. The USPA (United States Parachute Association) has statistics about how many people jump and how many have problems along the way – we’ll come to this in a bit.Essentially, skydiving is as safe as it can be. It sounds like a fluffy answer, but we have so many precautions in place to reduce risk that for many, the risk quotient is manageable.

	 <h1 class="sidetile">HONEYMOON TRIP</h1>
      <p>The point of the Maldives is that it is not a single large island but is, instead, a collection of thousands of tiny coral islands. ... Each island is surrounded by a lagoon of shallow water (though the Indian Ocean, with its deep blue water, lies beyond). It is the clearest water you will ever see. </p>
